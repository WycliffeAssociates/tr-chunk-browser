# translationRecorder Chunk Audio File Browser
This application can import and identify verses within tR audio file chunks. 
After importing tR audio files containing verses, you may selectively split verses into
separate files and merge verses into a chunk audio file, all while maintaining the tR metadata.

- **Split:** Splitting verses exports them as individual files, one file per verse.
- **Merge:** Merging verses exports them as a combined audio file
